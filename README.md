# MachineLearningNotebooks
This repository consists of the notebooks made for the assignments of the course Machine Learning at the Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering at Maastricht University.
Disclaimer: The code in the notebooks is my own work, apart from the bits supplied by the lecturers. It is fine by if you copy it for learning purposes, but I do not want my code to be used for plagiarism or any such things.
